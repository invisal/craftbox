/**
 * Shared contract for the subprocess-based native recording helpers
 * (native/macos-recorder, native/windows-recorder, native/linux-recorder)
 * -- a standalone executable per platform, spawned with one JSON config
 * argument, that owns the entire capture pipeline (video with cursor
 * hidden, system/mic audio, H.264 encode, MP4 mux) and writes directly to
 * the given output path. See the plan this was built from for why this
 * replaced an earlier in-process N-API addon attempt (a chain of
 * ARC/threading/IPC bugs that a real subprocess boundary avoids entirely).
 *
 * Permission handling lives inside each helper (CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess
 * on macOS; no OS-level gate on Windows/Linux) -- there's deliberately no
 * separate check/request permission surface here the way the old in-process
 * addon needed, since a failed/denied permission just surfaces as a normal
 * start failure (`NativeRecordingStartResult`'s `ok: false`).
